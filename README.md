# Am-I-Dumb
A remake of an old online quiz for android.
I had some time and thought it would be fun to remake an old quiz I took before that has sadly stopped working properly.
The app is simple, on startup you enter a username then the quiz begins. You must answer the 25 questions and then get your results. 
I currently have no plans to update this further however is partially incomplete as the original quiz would give you a percentile of which 
you fall based on the number of questions that you got right. This would need a large sample size. perhaps when I have more experience in user-data collection 
I will come back and finish this.
